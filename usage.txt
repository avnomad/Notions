General:

This version lets you draw a free-form curve with the mouse and displays, at
real time, the best straight line approximating the points of the curve
calculated using total least squares. A grid and two bent two-way arrows on a
circle are displayed. You can left-click on any one of the arrows and drag it in
a circular manner to rotate the arrows and the grid around their center.


Usage:

<press left mouse button> to start drawing. Do it over an arrow to start 
    dragging the arrows instead.
<move mouse with left button pressed> to draw xor to drag the arrows.
<release left mouse button> to stop drawing/dragging.
<press escape> to exit

No other press/release/move events are used.
