This version lets you draw free-form curves by dragging the mouse.
It then finds parts of the curve where the stylus moved 'fast' and parts where
it moved 'slow' using a threshold, caclulates a best straight line approximation
of each part using least squares and displays the result to the user.

<press enter> to calculate speeds and line segments
<press down arrow> or <press right arrow> to clear
<drag> any mouse button to draw
<press escape> to exit

mouse button press/release events and keyboard release events not used.
