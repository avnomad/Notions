General:

This version lets you draw a free-form curve with the mouse and displays, at 
real time, the best straight line approximating the points of the curve 
calculated using total least squares. It also displays that line with its slope 
rounded and again with both slope and intercept rounded. The three lines have 
different colors. A grid and two bent two-way arrows on a circle are displayed. 
You can left-click on any one of the arrows and drag it in a circular manner to 
rotate the arrows and the grid around their center.


Usage:

<press left mouse button> to start drawing. Do it over an arrow to start 
    dragging the arrows instead.
<move mouse with left button pressed> to draw xor to drag the arrows.
<release left mouse button> to stop drawing/dragging.
<press escape> to exit

No other press/release/move events are used.


Color Code:

purple: free-from curve
lime:   total least squares line
cyan:   lime line with its slope rounded to closest multiple ot PI/12
yellow: cyan line with its intercept rounded to grid cell size
blue:   cursor
