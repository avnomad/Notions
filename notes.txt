Notes:

This version (Mark III) is essentially the same as Mark II except that it uses 
DirectInput8 to acquire mouse and keyboard input instead of glut.
There are a few differences though like e.g. the absence of 'key repeat' 
function and that the bug that allowed the user to draw with the right mouse 
button is fixed.

As with Mark II, this is a good version to watch the algorithm work.

Note that this project (Mark III) is not likely to get any functionality or 
performance improvements. Only some bug fixes are done and these are in the 
interest of allowing one to see how this version of the program looked like.


Issues:

Polylines can be selected even when invisible.
