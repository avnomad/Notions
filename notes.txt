This project (Mark I) is frozen. Additional functionality, performance 
improvements and bug fixes are done in later projects.
Only portability issues are fixed in this branch to allow the program to run so 
that one can see how the first version looked like!


Issues:
When multiple strokes are drawn and <enter> is pressed a single threshold value 
is calculated from all strokes and for all strokes. The originally conceived 
algorithm demands independent thresholds for each stroke, so strictly speaking 
this is an error. But it's interesting to see how this effects the results. :)

Time associated with point is time of receipt not time of creation. If those 
vary much, a false speed value will be calculated...

Mouse report rate is greatly enhanced for a short period after stylus lands.
Also points seem to be lost during that period. The aforementioned seem to mess 
with the algorithm... (they can be to help windows' flicks work or glut related. 
Not sure yet.) (certainly the misinterpretations of handwriting to a flick gives 
a bad user experience!)



Fixed:
Hardcoded QueryPerformanceFrequency value fixed. (could cause speeds to go 
infinite on machines with smaller frequency)
