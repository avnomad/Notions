Notes:

This project was originally created to test components of the 'Unsorted Library' 
such as 'SquareGrid' and 'RotationIndicator' implemented using OpenGL display 
lists (hence the name). I also tested the total least squares algorithm.

You can't build this project without an installation of the 'Unsorted Library' 
and its behavior may change with the version of the library. Earlier versions of 
the library used the 'intThrower' hack to bypass glut's main loop and are 
unlikely to work on Windows 7 or later operating systems.

This project (display lists) is not active and unlikely to get any functionality 
or performance improvements. Only some bug fixes are done and these are in the 
interest of allowing one to see how this version of the program looked like.

There are some more things that can be displayed than documented in usage.txt if
one is willing to uncomment them and recompile.


Issues:

If one clicks 2 times with the left mouse button without moving it and before 
the first approximating lines are drawn an exception is thrown. This is to catch 
certain circumstances resulting in infinite 'best' lines. It's not considered a
bug.
