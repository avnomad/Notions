Notes:

This is the main and most complete version of the program.

You can't build this project without an installation of the 'Unsorted Library' 
and its behavior may change with the version of the library. Earlier versions of 
the library used the 'intThrower' hack to bypass glut's main loop and are 
unlikely to work on Windows 7 or later operating systems.


Issues:

1.  For program to work with digitizer you need to hardcode the fact that a 
    digitizer is used and the dimensions of the screen in the library code.
    This is mostly an issue of the library.
    
2.  Lines used to draw GUI text get thicker when zooming in or while the left 
    mouse button is released.
