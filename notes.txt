Notes:

This is the main and most complete version of the program.

You can't build this project without an installation of the 'Unsorted Library' 
and its behavior may change with the version of the library. Earlier versions of 
the library used the 'intThrower' hack to bypass glut's main loop and are 
unlikely to work on Windows 7 or later operating systems.


Issues:

1.  The program needs to be compiled for tablet to use the digitizer but then 
    the mouse sensitivity becomes very small, or compiled for mouse but then the
    digitizer sensitivity becomes too high.
    
2.  Lines used to draw GUI text get thicker when zooming in or while the left 
    mouse button is released.

3.  When using program on tablets the cursor and the pen need to be synchronized 
    once at program start before used.
