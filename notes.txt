Notes:

This is the best version to use in order to see how the algorithm works. 
(Although the version of the algorithm used in the 'Notions' branch is much more 
robust, it doesn't provide any user feedback of its internal operation.)

Note that this project (Mark II) is not likely to get any functionality or 
performance improvements. Only some bug fixes are done and these in the interest 
of allowing one to see how this version of the program looked like.


Issues:

Polylines can be selected even when invisible.

Can draw with right mouse button, but recognition is only done when left button
is released.


Fixed:

To decompose a stroke into line segments and recognize it as a polyline, an 
independent min/max/threshold is calculated for each stroke. The 'red-blue' 
coloring of points during display on the other hand, is currently based on the 
last calculated min/max/threshold  value. Thus what the user sees is not what 
was actually used by the algorithm.
