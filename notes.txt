Notes:

This version is essentially the same as Mark III but uses Boost::Thread to 
process input in one thread while rendering on another. This attempts to solve
the problem of not receiving input while the rendering thread waits for the
vertical synchronization signal (e.g. in glutSwapBuffers).

As with Mark II, this is a good version to watch the algorithm work.

Note that this project (Mark III thread) is not likely to get any functionality 
or performance improvements. Only some bug fixes are done and these are in the 
interest of allowing one to see how this version of the program looked like.


Issues:

Polylines can be selected even when invisible.

The synchronization between the threads may not be as efficient as it could and
seems to cause some fluctuations in the sampling rate of the input devices, 
which in turn seems to affect the observed speeds and ultimately the algorithm.
On the other hand, there was an issue with DirectInput which thought another
application had priority, so it may be because of that and not because of the 
synchronization.
